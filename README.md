Data Open Challenge
Challenge
Social isolation in seniors leads to negative health outcomes. TPL is developing programs to promote
social inclusion for seniors. Where should these programs be placed, and does the data inform what
types of programs are best for each community?

June is Seniors Month in Ontario, where we recognize the hard work seniors have done all their lives.
Furthermore, June 10th to June 16th is Loneliness Awareness Week. In recognition of those two events,
TPL’s challenge is centered on how we can continue to expand services for seniors living in Toronto.
TPL offers a wide range of programs that enhance seniors’ wellbeing, by providing access to educational
resources, fostering a culture of lifelong learning, and creating a communal space for residents to gather
and connect. (See following page for more details.)
A new program for seniors could be an event, course, workshop, or other resource.
Factors to consider:
 Changes to the senior population's demographics, including age groups, cultural backgrounds,
educational levels, and socioeconomic status.
 The specific needs and interests of seniors, such as social engagement programs, health
resources, or materials in languages spoken by the community.
For determining which library branch, or group of branches, the program could be made available, city
demographic and neighbourhood data could be overlaid with library branch location and characteristics
information to determine the best location for new seniors’ programs.

Background: Older Adult and Seniors’ Programs at Toronto Public Library
1. TPL programs are free and open to all. Older adults and seniors are welcome to attend
a wide range of general interest library programming for all adults, such as book clubs,
hobbies and crafts, and author talks.
2. TPL also hosts programs that meet identified needs of older adults and seniors,
including:
 Legal and Finance:
o Retirement planning, taxes and wills, or specific life events such as
incapacity or the death of a loved one

 Health & Wellness, to address healthy aging and fostering social connections
o Partnerships with the Alzheimer Society of Toronto, Baycrest, Toronto
Master Gardeners, and Mood Disorders Association of Ontario
o Topics such as: brain health, nutrition, hearing health, diabetes, caregiving,
dying and death, mental health, long-term care and aging at home
 Seniors' drop-ins and socials with board games, cards, films and crafts
3. Digital literacy skills programs are available at different skill levels. TPL offers beginner
level programs, teaching skills such as using a mouse and keyboard, browsing the
web, using email, searching with Google, and using Windows 10.
More advanced digital literacy classes are offered under a series called Seniors Digital
Life Skills with programs about developing skills to safely use the internet. These
classes focus on online entertainment, health information, travel and shopping.
Seniors E-Connect pairs teen volunteers and older adults to support the digital literacy
and confidence of the older adults.
TPL Community Librarians work in Toronto Seniors Housing Corporation buildings to
offer digital literacy programs and one-on-one Book-a-Librarian personalized
appointments for help with mobile devices, digital application support and library
services.
